## Plot
     
Aditya (Venkatesh) is a talented boxer who is banned from the sport for accusing his coach Dev (Zakir Hussain) of match-fixing. He becomes a disillusioned and alcoholic coach at the National Sports Academy in Hyderabad. He spots potential in a vegetable vendor, Rameshwari alias Ramudu (Ritika Singh), who is also the sister of a fellow coach Lux (Mumtaz Sorcar). He decides to train her despite her hostile attitude and reluctance to learn boxing.
     
Aditya faces many challenges in training Ramudu, such as her lack of discipline, her family's opposition, her love interest Gani (Nassar), and the corruption and politics in the boxing federation. He also has to deal with his own personal issues, such as his estranged wife Lakshmi (Ragini Dwivedi) and his health problems. He eventually manages to overcome all the obstacles and prepares Ramudu for the state-level championship.
     
However, Dev, who is now the head of the boxing federation, tries to sabotage Ramudu's chances by bribing her opponent Madhi (Sanchana Natarajan) to injure her during the match. Ramudu suffers a severe eye injury but refuses to give up. She fights back with Aditya's guidance and wins the match by knockout. She also wins Aditya's respect and affection. The film ends with Aditya and Ramudu celebrating their victory and looking forward to the national-level championship.

## Review
     
Guru is a well-made film that delivers a strong message of perseverance, passion and empowerment. The film is faithful to the original Tamil version but also adds some elements that suit the Telugu audience. The film has a tight screenplay that keeps the viewers engaged throughout. The film also has some humorous moments that lighten up the mood.
     
The film's biggest strength is its performances. Venkatesh delivers one of his best performances as Aditya, a flawed but determined coach who transforms Ramudu's life. He portrays the character's emotions and expressions with perfection. Ritika Singh is equally impressive as Ramudu, a rebellious but talented boxer who learns to respect herself and her coach. She shows great physicality and intensity in her role. Nassar, Zakir Hussain, Tanikella Bharani and Mumtaz Sorcar provide good support in their respective roles.
     
The film's music by Santhosh Narayanan is another highlight. The songs are catchy and suit the mood of the film. The background score is also effective and enhances the impact of the scenes. The cinematography by K.A. Sakthivel captures the rustic beauty of the coastal areas and the gritty atmosphere of the boxing ring. The editing by Sathish Suriya is crisp and smooth. The action choreography by Stunt Silva is realistic and thrilling.

Guru is a film that deserves to be watched by everyone who loves sports and drama. It is a film that inspires and entertains. It is a film that showcases the power of a guru and a shishya.
